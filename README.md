# Ecotone

Ecotone is an affiliate ecommerce store of sustainably and ethically made apparel products. From shirts to coats to shoes, Leaf has it all. Search by color, category, and/or gender in the search bar or click the dropdown menus of categories and brands to narrow your search. 

Furthermore, on each product page you will see the brand's ethical and sustainability ratings that made that product. In addition, you can create an account, log in, log out, delete it.

Check out the screenshots in this repo to see what the finished site looks like.

Also, if interested, check out the wireframe design I made at the beginning of the project:

We want to make the economy rooted in more ethical incentive structures. Why can't we grow a healthy world one Leaf at a time?

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JSCharting

Future Goals:

I want to add more products so that the user experience is more exciting.

I want to fix the bug with the JSCharting Graph that multiplies after you click on multiple products.

I want to make the footer stay in the bottom of the document even when no products are clicked.

I want to allow the user to click 'All Categories' or 'All Brands' after clicking on other options and have it filter it accordingly.

I want to get affiliate links to make it a real store.

I want to show the money that was donated through our affiliate revenue in the product section to three different charities (Trees, The Rainforest Foundation, and the Malaria Consortium) from our affiliate revenue.
